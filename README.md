## Introduction
This is an OpenGL 3D renderer created with the guidance of LearnOpenGL by Joey DeVries. You can find his websites here: https://learnopengl.com/.
This project is meant to showcase my learning journey of OpenGL and computer graphics. As I pursue my learning, I will update this project in accordance.
The main files that will be modified are Main.cpp and the shader program files.

I will add the following header and source files from LearnOpenGL: Shader, Camera, Model, Mesh
